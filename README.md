# QuoteAPPAbaxter
We were given the task to create a mobile APP that.

- Loaded and save quotes from a JSON file. Each quote should consist of the quote and the author
- Display a random quote when you tap a “Random Quote” button.
- Have two text entry fields for adding a new quote.
- Add a Boolean “favourite” property to your quote class. By default, it should be set to false.
- Add a Favourite button that allows the user to choose which is his/hers favourite quotes.
- Add a button labelled “Favourites” that takes the user to a second screen that lists their favourites. 

In addition to these features I thought it would be fun to add a couple of other features, such as.

- Next and previous buttons to scroll through Quotes.
- A delete button that allows the user to delete displayed quotes.

To get straight to the code I edited head to quoteAPPAbaxter >>> quoteAPPAbaxter.
